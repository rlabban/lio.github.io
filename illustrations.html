         I basically typed the word design a bunch of times and tested how much I could change it. Whether it'd be cutting up the letters, distorting them, changing the angles or the opacity, or even make the letters look wavy.

            I had to create a a conceptual logo for a faux comic book store in a short amount of time. I decided to take the name of the comic book store and use it as inspiration when I was designing the logo. The idea was that the childlike nature of the logo would appeal to the store's business model of marketing to a younger demographic.

            I used a warp trick to create a logo design for a nondescript smartphone company. I did this by typing a bold "M" and using the warp tool in order to stretch and pull the "M" in multiple directions. My goal was to see how unrecognizable I could get the "M" to look from it's original shape.

              If I ever came up with the idea for a publishing company, I wanted it to be cool and I think my logo represents that.
          </p>
          <p>
              My original thought was to make a company that publishes comic books. So I kept thinking what came to mind when I thought of comics. The first word was paper. I then thought of money because paper can be slang for money. When I thought money, I thought about the saying “make it rain” and then the term paper trail came to mind. I then thought to illustrate this concept in multiple ways through multiple sketches until I figured out that the design I chose was the perfect balance of being simple, memorable, and distinct. It was also the easiest to resize and format in different settings.
          </p>
          <p>
              For the design, I used my own hand to design the hand in the logo. I make the color look like skin because it makes the logo look less abstract and more recognizable. I added a thin outline so the shape of the hand is easier to see. For the stack of cash in the hand, I went with a simple green rectangle with no outline so it wouldn’t look like there was too much going on. I did the same thing with the bills flying in the air. With the money itself, if I gave them an outline or any more detail, the logo would look unprofessional and more like an icon or a sticker. The reason I chose the typeface that I did is because it looked like nice handwriting that wasn’t messy, and it compliments the hand in the logo so it doesn’t look out of place. I put the text under the logo for two reasons. The first is that there was more room and wouldn’t force people looking at the logo to look around too much and take their eyes off most of the logo. The second is that with the text below the hand, it makes it look like the hand itself wrote it down.
          </p>
          <p>
              Overall, I’m very proud of what I’ve done with this logo. I managed to take a concept for a comic book publishing company and turn it into something where the companies products could be expanded upon given the logo wasn’t so synonymous with comic books that it couldn’t be applied to other types of publishable products.

            This magazine was a great opportunity to showcase my abilities with not only creating folios and conceptual illustrations, but also how I can take those illustrations and orient them onto a magazine along with text from a story that is pleasing to look at.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing that I asked myself when I was trying to figure out what I should put in my magazine that would actually pertain to the story was what examples of technology I should draw and put into my spreads. Once I read through the article that I chose, I found what examples of tech Nick Bilton, the writer, used in his story and used those as references. I decided that since a large part of the story is about vinyl, I made it the main theme of the magazine layout. Also, I decided to use the examples of tech at the end of the story to give the last page on the spread some life and vibrance. I put the name and logo of my magazine publishing company at the top because I’ve seen other magazines do that and I wanted to fill the dead space.
        </p>
        <p>
            I kept the original typography of my logo because I thought it was important to keep the logo as authentic and accurate as possible since I had originally chosen that typography for that logo because I thought they worked well together. As for the typography of the header text, I wanted to use fonts that I felt represented the era of some of this tech. I wanted fonts that I thought looked “groovy” or “edgy” because a lot of this tech became popular between the 70’s and 90’s. For the body text, I settled on a font that I thought was easy to read in large chunks and was a nice break from the more elaborate fonts in the magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The illustrations that I drew for the magazine took longer than expected to complete. I uploaded refence material that I found into Illustrator and used the pen tool to trace the outlines of the images. From there, I colored in all of the lines that I made. I wanted to make my drawings look as clean as possible and look like there was a lot of effort put into each of them. The car took especially long because of the number of lines and different colors with varying levels of lightness and darkness. In order to make these drawings pop out more on my magazine spreads, I decided to keep the background of the pages white for a noticeable contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I’m very proud of what I’ve done with this magazine. I managed to create illustrations that I thought represented the content of the story well. Also, I was able to take those drawing and make them work well with the text on each of the pages. I strongly feel that people will be able to read the magazine article and enjoy it.
