<p>
	My game is an idea for a game that has been in the making for a number of years. I the concept of the game is an RPG where the player plays as a select group of bugs to expand their bug-utopian society.
</p>
<p>Character Sheet</p>
<p>
	The good characters are meant to be the more generic bugs that are less universally scary. Some examples include caterpillars, bees, or ants. The neutral characters are animals that can be used for livestock. Some examples include gophers, chickens, or sea turtles. The bad characters are meant to be the scarier bugs and animals that eat bugs. Some examples include spiders, scorpions, or bats.
</p>
<p>Environments</p>
<p>
	The environments that I came up with are meant to represent the places where the bugs would live together and the places where they would get supplies or food. The Tree HQ is where the bugs live and where the player grows their society and land. The Beach Shack is where the player can get food or some supplies for aesthetics. The Junkyard is where the player can get supplies to further build their society.
</p>
<p>Vehicles</p>
<p>
	The mode of transportation depends on where and how the player is traveling. If the player is traveling underground, then they are riding gophers. If the player is traveling above ground, then they are driving carts made from the exoskeletons of scorpions. If the player is traveling by water, then they are traveling inside the shell of a sea turtle.
