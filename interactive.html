            For this project, I decided to create a website that made a game out of creating a poem. The way that I would work is that the user would click the screen to have a random word drop and there would be a select number of words. Then the user could press the dice to shuffle the words around.

        For this project, I made a digital collage in the P5.js editor. The idea is that the viewer watches a collage of GIFs of Patrick Star, a cartoon character from the TV show <cite class="italic">SpongeBob Squarepants</cite>, making one of his most well-known noises. The noise he makes gets louder as the viewer continues to watch and listen. The reason I did this is because I wanted to create an experience that would make the viewer feel a rising sense of discomfort and annoyance. This is because that's how I felt when I was working on a similar project earlier that involved those Patrick Star GIFs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, this being a revised version of my second project, I added a few things to make it a much more fulfilling experience. First, I added a few more GIFs. Second, I distorted the audio of the sound Patrick makes in the collage. Third, I added the sound of an alarm that plays about a minute into the collage. That was to make the collage more self-aware of how "annoying" it is. Especially since people can understand the concept of having an alarm play over something annoying or cringeworthy; whether it's from a YouTube video or even just in their own mind.

      For this project, I used Unity and Vuforia to create AR graffiti. The idea is that the user wears a makeshift sleeve on their wrist; which is really a paper cup with the KFC logo on it that I cut up. When that happens, as long as the user is standing infront of an AR camera with the KFC logo facing the screen, they will see a video pop up. The video will be a rotating USB drive displaying information about itself. The reason I did this is because I wanted to recreate the wrist comm in <cite class="italic">Batman: Arkham Knight</cite>.

    For this project, I created a game written in Python Where a player finds out how many states they can list. The idea is that the player would be prompted to type in as many states as they can think of. After that, they are given a score and a letter grade based on how many states they got correct.
